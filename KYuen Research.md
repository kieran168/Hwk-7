# Article #1: Who takes Personal Finance
Jaclyn J. Beierlein, Margot Neverett, (2013). "Who takes personal finance?", http://ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=94644713&site=ehost-live

This article has certainly peaked my interests because I always believed that if people took a course in personal finance that they would make much smarter decisions with their money. 

## Data
Institutional data from admission applications and transcripts of 17,499 students at East Carolina University. I believe this type of data should be accessible by asking for it from a college or university if they can provide it to me anonymized. 

## Econometric Techniques
They made dummy variables (0/1) of all the variables they have and ran a t-test to determine the difference between the group who took the personal finance course and those who did not. They also performed a logistic regression to account for spurious relationships amongst the variables. Used ordinal regression to analyze students' grades.

## What question is addressed?
This articles primary question is: What are the characteristics of traditional undergraduate students that take the univeristy personal finance class?

# Article #2
For my 2nd article I have been trying to find a topic related to personal finance. The following are examples of questions I have that I am having help guide me towards the topic and database that will hopefully help me get started on this final project very soon! Stay tuned for more updates from my Kevin!

What is the impact of consumerism on a person/household's personal finances?
