### Article #1
Jaclyn J. Beierlein, Margot Neverett, (2013). "Who takes personal finance?", http://ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=94644713&site=ehost-live

This article has certainly peaked my interests because I always believed that if people took a course in personal finance that they would make much smarter decisions with their money. 

#### Data
Institutional data from admission applications and transcripts of 17,499 students at East Carolina University. I believe this type of data should be accessible by asking for it from a college or university if they can provide it to me anonymized. 

#### Econometric Techniques
They made dummy variables (0/1) of all the variables they have and ran a t-test to determine the difference between the group who took the personal finance course and those who did not. They also performed a logistic regression to account for spurious relationships amongst the variables. Used ordinal regression to analyze students' grades.

#### What question is addressed?
This articles primary question is: What are the characteristics of traditional undergraduate students that take the univeristy personal finance class?

### Article #2
Hancock, Adam M.; Jorgensen, Bryce L.; Swanson, Melvin S., (2013). "College Students and Credit Card Use: The Role of Parents, Work Experience, Financial Knowledge, and Credit Card Attitudes", http://ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1412539&site=ehost-live

#### Data
The data they used were from the College Student Financial Literacy Surveys (CSFLS), which measures the financial knowledge, attitudes, behavior, influences, and personal demographics that may affect the fianncial literacy of college students.

#### Econometric Techniques
Logistical regression to predict likelihood of having two or more credit cards.
Logistical regression predicting likelihood of having more than $500 in credit card debt

#### What question is addressed?
This study is trying to examine how students' credit card behaviors (i.e. number of credit cards and amount of debt) is influenced by: parental interactions, years of work experience, financial knowledge, credit card attitudes, and personal characteristics.

### Further Research
The following are examples of questions I have that I am having help guide me towards the topic and database that will hopefully help me get started on this final project very soon! I have also tried to start my research by looking at the various databases but I realized it's difficult to "find a topic" through that method. Which is why I have drafted up questions that I want answered and I'm trying to gear them towards a more "quantitative" path. More to come!

What is the impact of consumerism on a person/household's personal finances? 

What is the impact of consumerism on debt?

How does a course in personal finance in high school impact a person's finances in the long-term? short-term?

How much more income is earned by someone who has taken a personal finance course in high school? In college? after graduating from college?

How much more money is spent by people who use credit cards more often on a daily basis versus people who use paper cash more often on a daily basis?
